If you would like to see an app that is not yet added, [open an issue](https://github.com/ratingrecipes/ratingrecipes/issues)!

### How to discover new rating recipes
We use [jadx](https://github.com/skylot/jadx) to analyze Android APKs and find out exactly how apps ask users for ratings and reviews.

We [created a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egxv9xWN988) detailing this process step-by-step in case you wish to analyze an app.
